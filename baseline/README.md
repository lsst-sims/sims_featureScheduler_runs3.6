New updates since 3.5 baseline

* LARGE INCREASE IN DOWNTIME IN YEAR 1!
* INCLUDING TELESCOPE JERK (lowering telescope motion efficency)
* INCLUDING TARGET-OF-OPPORTUNITY OBSERVATIONS (also lowering efficency, especially after year 1)
* adjust to twilight earth interior observations to not attempt when moon blocks too much of the sky
* max ddf dither to 0.2 degrees (from 0.7 degrees)
* xxx--probably some fiddles to the alt/az masks that should be a negligable change
